      Question: If AI is regulated like medicine, should it be regulated like a medicine?
    We can start with the first two points: You're a scientist who believes in the benefits and harms of AI. If so, then you're a scientist who believes in the harm and benefits of AI. If not, then you're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI.
So, you're a scientist who believes in the benefits and harms of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. You're a scientist who believes in the harms and benefits of AI. _________________
